# Cowork Stack Brief — The Web Foundry

This document gives Cowork the context it needs to turn a completed client intake form into a Build Plan. Feed this once as background context — it doesn't change per client.

---

## What We Build

Static websites for local Cincinnati small businesses. Fast, mobile-first, designed to convert visitors into customers (calls, bookings, walk-ins). Free build, ~$20/month ongoing hosting.

## Stack & What It Means for Build Plans

| Layer | Tech | What Cowork needs to know |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| Framework | Astro (static) | Every page is a file — all routes must be defined in the Build Plan |
| CMS | Sanity.io | Only build schemas for content the client will edit themselves. Everything else is hardcoded. |
| Forms | Cloudflare Worker | Pre-built. Just need: form type, destination email, and a site ID slug. |
| Hosting | Coolify on VPS | Need domain + DNS access before launch. |

## Key Decisions Cowork Makes From Intake Answers

### Menu Approach (restaurants, cafés, bakeries, bars)
Map the client's intake answers to one of these:

| Client said... | Recommend |
|---------------|-----------|
| Menu rarely changes + has a PDF | **PDF in Sanity** — simple upload, client replaces when needed |
| Menu changes often + wants one login | **Custom Sanity menu schema** — we build it, client edits in CMS |
| Menu changes often + wants QR codes or a dedicated tool | **GloriaMenus** (~$30/mo third-party) — we embed it on the site |
| No menu | Skip entirely |

### Sanity Content Types
For each content type the client checked as "I want to update myself," include it in the Build Plan as a Sanity schema. Common ones:

- `hours` — business hours (day, open, close, closed flag)
- `gallery` — photos with alt text (max 5)
- `menuPdf` — PDF file upload
- `menuItems` — structured menu (only if custom Sanity menu chosen)
- `services` — name, description, optional price
- `team` — name, role, photo, bio
- `testimonials` — quote, author, optional star rating
- `events` — name, date, description

If the client said "I'd rather have you handle all updates," minimize Sanity schemas — maybe just hours and contact info.

### Booking / Reservations
If the client needs booking, note which third-party platform in the Build Plan. We embed it (iframe or script), not build it. Common platforms: Calendly, Acuity, Square Appointments, OpenTable, Resy.

### Blog
We don't currently build blogs. If the client requested one, flag it in the Build Plan as an open question for Dreux to review.

## Build Plan Output Template
